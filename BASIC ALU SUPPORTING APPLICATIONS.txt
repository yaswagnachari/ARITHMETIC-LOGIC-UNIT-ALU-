1. Arithmetic Unit – Adder/Subtractor
Core: A ripple-carry binary adder (built from full adders for each bit).

Mode control (M):

When M = 0 → perform addition.

When M = 1 → perform subtraction using two’s complement trick:

B inputs are XOR ’d with M to invert when subtracting.

The initial carry-in (C₀) = M.

Operation:

Result = 𝐴+𝐵⊕𝑀+𝑀

Result=A+B⊕M+M

If M=0: it's A + B.

If M=1: it's A – B (i.e., A + ¬B + 1). 

This way, one adder handles both add and subtract. Use the final carry-out as the carry/borrow flag.

2. Logic Unit
For bitwise operations:

AND: A ∧ B

OR: A ∨ B

NOT: ¬A (unary; ignore B or treat B as don’t care)

Each bit is processed independently using simple gates. 

3. Multiplexer (MUX) for Output Selection
All outputs from the arithmetic unit and logic unit feed an n-bit wide multiplexer.

Control signals decode the desired operation:

e.g., 3-bit Op-code:

000 = ADD, 001 = SUB,

010 = AND, 011 = OR, 100 = NOT, etc. 

4. Status Flags
Zero (Z): Output is zero (e.g., via an OR-tree and inverter).

Carry/Borrow (C): Final carry-out from adder.

Overflow (V): Detect via XOR between final carry and previous carry.

Negative (N): Most significant bit of the result (sign bit). 

5. Putting It All Together
  1.Inputs:

Operands: A (n-bit), B (n-bit)

Mode bits: M (arithmetic vs logic) & Op-code bits

  2.Arithmetic path:

B ⊕ M → fed into ripple-carry adder

Carry-in = M

  3.Logic path:

Independent AND, OR, NOT gates

  4.Output selection:

n-bit MUX selects between arithmetic result and chosen logic result

  5.Flag generation:

Carry-out → C

Overflow logic → V

MSB → N

Zero detect → Z

4‑bit Example Circuit
Use four full-adders for 4-bit operations.

XOR each B-bit with M.

Use a simple 4‑to‑1 MUX for logic ops and another 2‑to‑1 MUX between arithmetic vs logic outputs.

Select lines: M + 2 control bits = 3 total. 

Summary Table
Operation	Mode (M)	Op-code	B XOR?	Carry-in	Result Source
ADD	0	000	No	0	Arithmetic
SUB	1	001	Yes	1	Arithmetic
AND	1	010	—	—	Logic AND
OR	1	011	—	—	Logic OR
NOT	1	100	—	—	Logic NOT

Bonus: Expandability & Efficiency
To scale beyond 4 bits, just add more full-adders (ripple-carry).

For faster arithmetic, replace ripple-carry with a carry‑lookahead adder.

🛠️ Implementation Tips
Prototype: Use Logisim or breadboard with TTL chips (e.g., 74LS283 for adders, 74LS08 for AND, 74LS32 for OR).

Control unit: Can be a small ROM or simple combinational decoder from Op-codes.

Flags: Useful for branching and decision-making in CPU-like systems.
